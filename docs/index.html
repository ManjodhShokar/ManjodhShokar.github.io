      <h3>Manjodh Shokar</h3>
      <p> Hello, I am Manjodh and before starting my course at city university I had very little coding experience. My only coding experience is from 
      doing a little bit of python during my computer science GCSEs.


Add some ut yourself. For now we're happy to know anything you're
      willing to share about yourself (though one thing we are curious about is your programming
      experience before bootcamp). As your progress through your degree at City you will 
      be able to add more here (e.g., interests, skills, experience, a link to a CV). However,
      even then, it's better to keep this information concise (about a paragraph or two)
      and let your CV and the projects below to do the rest of the talking.</p>

    <h3>MY GAME</h3>
    <p>
        My game, concluding the 2nd semester Programming in Java Module at City(20220. This 
        project demonstrates my understanding of java, with things like arrays, inheritance,
        encapsulation, working with files, GUI etc. I created a game where the player character
        has to find 3 different keys around the map which will be used to open the lock at the 
        end of the map. Opening the lock reveals a star which the player can walk into, which 
        will take the player to the next level. Each level has unique challenges, from different
        enemy types, different environments and a bit of parkour. The player character has access
        to 2 different items, a pistol and a key, the pistol can be used to destroy enemies and 
        the key is used to open the locks. Each level is vastly different from each other, they 
        have different backgrounds, music, enemies, platforms and items.There are lives presented 
        on the foreground which increases if you heal, or decrease if you take damage. The GUI 
        allows the player to pause the game, go to the next level, adjust the volume of the game
        and to make save files.          


	My first programming project, concluding the 2 week Programming Bootcamp at 
	City (2020). This Processing project demonstrates a comprehensive understanding 
	of the use of arrays, loops, and randomness. I created a forest scene in which 
	details of each tree (e.g. position, trunk color and size, crown color and shape) 
	are stored in parallel 2D arrays. Trees are arranged in a regular grid but their 
	positions are jittered by  small random offsets to create the impression of a real 
	forest. Similarly, each tree trunk and crown has a individual color shade, obtained
	using  random variations of brown and green. Finally, the forest changes over time:
	trees grow and their crowns become more pale to suggest seasonal change ( from 
        spring to autumn).
